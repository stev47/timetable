timetable
=========

This project came up, since the [LSF][] of the [University of Stuttgart][uni] had several issues in terms of displaying a timetable.

Plans for the future
--------------------

* Parsing [public available information][data] to render the schedule semi-automatically
* Converting the result to PDF for printing
